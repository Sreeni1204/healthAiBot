The Wikipedia page offers a basic overview of the disease, including its viral nature and common symptoms like runny nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing. The CDC website details the typical symptoms and offers recommendations for managing cold symptoms, including over-the-counter medications and probiotics. The MedlinePlus encyclopedia provides a more detailed explanation of the disease, including its potential causes and diagnostic considerations, while also including information about the most common symptoms and remedies. The PMC article delves deeper into the underlying mechanisms of the common cold, including its relationship to allergies and asthma, and offers insights into potential preventative measures.\n",

The information also touches upon the potential role of probiotics in preventing colds, which is a noteworthy detail considering the frequent occurrence of colds.\n",
